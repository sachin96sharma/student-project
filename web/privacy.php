      <p>9. CONTROLS FOR  DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
      <p>Most web browsers and  some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track  (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy  preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and  collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and  implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently  respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically  communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online  tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about  that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
